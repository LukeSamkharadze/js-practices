## Add public method to coffee maker
Add a public method `addWater(amount)` to the coffee machine that will add water.

At the same time, of course, all necessary checks should be carried out - for positiveness and capacity.

Source code: 

```javascript
function CoffeeMachine(power, capacity) {
	var waterAmount = 0;
	var WATER_HEAT_CAPACITY = 4200;
	
    function getTimeToBoil() {
		return waterAmount * WATER_HEAT_CAPACITY * 80 / power;
    }
	
    this.setWaterAmount = function(amount) {
		if (amount < 0) {
			throw new Error("Value has to be positive");
		}
		if (amount > capacity) {
			throw new Error("You can't put more water, than " + capacity);
		}
		waterAmount = amount;
	};
	
    function onReady() {
		console.log('Coffee is ready');
    }
    
	this.run = function() {
		setTimeout(onReady, getTimeToBoil());
	};
}
```

For next code you should get the error:

```javascript
var coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100000, 400);
coffeeMachine.addWater(200);
coffeeMachine.addWater(100);
coffeeMachine.addWater(300); // You can't put more water, than 400
coffeeMachine.run();
```
