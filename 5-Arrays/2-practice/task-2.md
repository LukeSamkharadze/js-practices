#### Task 2

Create your own implementation of function `filter`, logic and behavior should be the same as original method.

Function should contain checks:

- First parameter required and has to be only array
- Second parameter required and has to be only function

```javascript
const arr = [1,2,3];
filter(arr, function(item, i, arr) {});
```
